    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy.
    // They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    console.log(players, team5, team4, team3, team2);
    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
